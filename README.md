# DebugNIF

An escript for debugging a NIF library in a debugger. It automates the process described here, [Debug Erlang NIF library on macOS and Linux](https://cocoa-research.works/2022/02/debug-erlang-nif-library/).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `debug_nif` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:debug_nif, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/debug_nif>.
